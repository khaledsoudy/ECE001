</ul>
<h1 style="color:red;">1. Python

</h1>
<p style="color:black;">Probably one of the easiest languages out there to start with for beginners because of how user-friendly its syntax is, how widely it’s used and what a big community it has around it. Python is a high-level, object-oriented language and can be used for data mining and visualisation, machine learning, web applications, game development and honestly anything else you can think of. Some of the major organizations and companies that use Python are Google, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, DropBox, NASA.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">2. Java
</h1>
<p style="color:black;">Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world right now! It isn’t as beginner-friendly as Python, as it was designed to feel similar to C++ but simpler to use.

Java is also a high-level, object-oriented language. One of its main draws is that it’s very powerful and secure and so all of the banking application development happens in Java only. It’s perfect for someone looking to work in Android development, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, or game/desktop app development. Major organizations that use Java are Airbnb, Uber, eBay, Pinterest, Groupon, Spotify, Pandora.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">3. JavaScript

</h1>
<p style="color:black;">JavaScript is a client-side programming language, meaning that it works in the user’s browser – as opposed to interacting with a server. It’s a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented programming language. It’s mostly used for front-end development. Don’t confuse JavaScript with Java though – they’re very different! 

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web and in fact, you’re interacting with it right now by interacting with this page. And most likely on the website, you visited before. And the one you will go to next. It is traditionally paired with HTML & CSS and is a front-end language used to create interactive websites, but thanks to recent technologies like Node.js, it is possible to use JavaScript as a backend language! Needless to say, JavaScript is very popular and is the language of choice for many, many developers.

Major organizations that use JavaScript are WordPress, Soundcloud, Khan Academy, Linkedin, Groupon, Yahoo and many others.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">4. Ruby
</h1>
<p style="color:black;">Ruby is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. It’s also very beginner-friendly and you can start building things fairly quickly with the framework called Rails (this is where the expression Ruby on Rails comes from). It’s used for web app development, robotics, networking, system administration and security. It is great for simulations and is even used for those by NASA!

Some of the major organizations that use it are Github, Scribd, Groupon, NASA Langley Research Center, Motorola, Google (SketchUp). Basecamp, Amazon, Twitter and Groupon were all created using Ruby on Rails.

Ruby’s founder, Yukihiro Matsumoto, intended it to be “simple in appearance, but it is very complex inside, just like our human body.”</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">5. C

</h1>
<p style="color:black;">It is probably one of the most widely-used languages in tech right now. 

It is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications – meaning that it’s widely used for developing device drivers.

It’s pretty powerful and was the inspiration for many advanced programming languages, including C++, Java C#, JavaScript and Pearl.

It is used to develop systems applications that are integrated into operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux, as well as embedded software. Systems Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Industrial Automation, Computer Graphics, Space Research, Image Processing and Game Programming.

Major organizations that use C are Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, Cisco, Raytheon.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">6. C#</h1>
<p style="color:black;">C# is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means it supports multiple programming paradigms or types of logic. 

It was developed in the 2000s by Microsoft within its .NET initiative – and was based on C, C++ and Java languages. As a result, it’s very similar to those languages and is widely used for developing Windows desktop applications and games. It can be used for almost anything though, including gaming, web applications and is becoming increasingly popular for mobile development too.

It is widely used in IT, Engineering, Design, Professional Services, Management and Quality Control.

Major organizations that use C# are Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett Packard.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">7. C++
</h1>
<p style="color:black;">C++ is an object-oriented, middle-level programming language. It was created to be an extension of the C programming language that provides a higher-level of abstraction but is still powerful and efficient.

It’s a general-purpose programming language that is used a lot to work with System/Application Software, Drivers, Client-Server Applications and Embedded Firmware.

Major companies that use C++ are Google, Mozilla, Winamp, Adobe, Amazon, Lockheed Martin.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">8. PHP
</h1>
<p style="color:black;">PHP is a multi-paradigm programming language, designed for creating dynamic web pages that effectively work with databases. It is a general-purpose language and is widely used for Web Application Development, Server-Side Scripting, Command Line Scripting. The newest versions of PHP have been rewritten, so you can’t see the same inconsistency that existed in the first organic version, but still, that’s pretty fun! 

Major organizations that use PHP are Facebook, Yahoo, CyberCoders, NextGen.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">9. PERL
</h1>
<p style="color:black;">Perl is a high-level scripting language that first appeared in 1987 and has since developed into a small family of two separate languages, Perl 5 and Perl 6.

What Perl was originally meant for was text processing and manipulation, but it has since found further applications ranging from web development to system administration.

Perl evolved throughout the years into a powerful tool that can be used on pretty much any operating system on the planet. Therefore, it’s sometimes referred to as the “Swiss army knife” of computer languages, too.

Perl takes its best features from other programming languages such as C, for instance. It’s comparable to PHP or Python to a certain extent, too.

However, in contrast to Python, Perl usually offers multiple solutions to a single problem. In this way it’s similar to Ruby, where there’s no one single best way to solve a specific problem.</p>
<h1 style="color:red;">10. SWIFT
</h1>
<p style="color:black;">Back in 2014, Apple developed their own programming language now known as Swift. Before that, the de facto language for iOS development was Objective-C.

Hence, Swift is aimed at iOS and OS X developers, giving them the perfect tools for creating the next big thing on the app market.

Considering the huge demand in the mobile app market, it’s no surprise that Swift quickly became very popular. It scales nicely and it’s fast. Furthermore, Swift is heavily influenced by Ruby and Python, so it’s very beginner-friendly and easy to use.

However, since it’s somewhat of a freshman compared to other languages, the support community for Swift might be a bit smaller than for the more established languages in the bunch. But like with any other language, it’s just a matter of time.</p>
